I am currently a research engineer at Qualcomm AI Research. My main research focuses on 3D reconstruction from video. I am also broadly interested in mathematics and programming languages.

Prior to joining Qualcomm I obtained an MS in computer science at NYU. Before that I graduated with a BS and an MS both in applied mathematics from Fudan University.

## Teaching
+ Teaching assistant: DS-GY 3001 Advanced Python for Data Science at NYU CDS, Spring 2021

## Software Package(s)
+ **Neural IMage Assessment**  
  Implementation of [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.05424) which predicts photo aesthetic scores that mimics human perception. It does so by learning an empirical distribution of photographer ratings.
